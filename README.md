### Introduction

We LTP staff members go on a lot of tangents about different web technologies, best practices, and various online articles. Rather than let all of that knowledge go to waste or get lost in Slack groups, we're going to keep track of everything we mention here, so that you might find your way back to a particular nugget of wisdom.

### HTML CSS
> These are resources about HTML and CSS. From elements to rules to colors, we'll keep adding links until we cover all the basics.

#### HTML
* [List of HTML Elements](https://www.w3schools.com/TAGs/default.asp)

#### CSS
* [List of CSS Rules](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/)
* [Intro to Web Colors](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_colors.asp)

### Frameworks
> Frameworks are just collections of pre-written code that you can utilize in your projects. The ones we have listed under [Front End](#front-end) are basically just precompiled sets of CSS and JavaScript that help you make a pretty looking website without having to get into any of the nitty gritty.

#### Front End
* [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
Version 3 is the latest stable release. Version 4 just went into beta.
* [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/)
We use Version 3 in our online videos. You can try to use a newer version, but you will run into syntax problems between the two.
* [jQuery Mobile](https://jquerymobile.com/)
We recommend using Version 1.4.5 - and demo code is available [here](http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.4.5/).
